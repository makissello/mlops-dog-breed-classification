# Dog Breed Classification - Operationalizing an AWS ML project

## üëã About This Project

In this project, I trained and deployed an image classification model for dog breed classification using AWS SageMaker. I started with a complete ML workflow and focused on adapting it for **production-grade deployment**. This involved configuring the entire pipeline to be scalable, cost-efficient, and secure using several key AWS tools and services. My goal was to turn research-grade code into a real-world machine learning product.

## ‚úÖ What I Did

- **Trained and deployed the model on SageMaker**, selecting the most appropriate instance types and configuring multi-instance training to handle larger datasets more efficiently.
- Modified the project to also support **EC2-based training and deployment**, giving me more flexibility in compute choices and deeper control over the training environment.
- Set up a **Lambda function** to serve real-time predictions from my deployed SageMaker model, and configured **concurrency settings** to ensure smooth performance even under load.
- Enabled **auto-scaling** for the SageMaker endpoint to handle dynamic traffic, reducing cost during idle times and improving responsiveness during peak use.
- Carefully reviewed and applied **AWS security best practices**, including IAM roles and policies, to protect data and services from unauthorized access.

## üîë Most Valuable Skills Gained

Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with some of the most important aspects of ML engineering:

- **Cloud infrastructure management** for ML workflows, especially understanding how to pick and configure compute resources wisely.
- **Deploying scalable, real-time ML pipelines** using AWS Lambda, SageMaker endpoints, and API integration.
- **Cost optimization strategies** by selecting the right instance types and enabling auto-scaling.
- **Security configuration in AWS**, including IAM, networking boundaries, and access controls, which are critical in real-world deployments.
- The overall mindset of taking a project from ‚Äúresearch code‚Äù to a production-ready pipeline, which is a core responsibility of ML engineers in industry settings.

This project not only sharpened my technical skills with AWS but also deepened my understanding of how to **bridge the gap between data science and engineering**. I now feel much more confident deploying, securing, and optimizing ML models in real-world, scalable applications.

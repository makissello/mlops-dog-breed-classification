# Dog Breed Classification - Operationalizing an AWS ML project

## üëã About This Project

In this project, I started with a completed image classification model for dog breed classification, which had already been trained and deployed on AWS SageMaker. My goal was to take that initial ML codebase and bring it up to **production-grade standards** by integrating it with AWS services and optimizing for scalability, cost-efficiency, and security.

## ‚úÖ What I Did

- **Trained and deployed the model on SageMaker**, selecting the most appropriate instance types and configuring multi-instance training to handle larger datasets more efficiently.
- Modified the project to also support **EC2-based training and deployment**, giving me more flexibility in compute choices and deeper control over the training environment.
- Set up a **Lambda function** to serve real-time predictions from my deployed SageMaker model, and configured **concurrency settings** to ensure smooth performance even under load.
- Enabled **auto-scaling** for the SageMaker endpoint to handle dynamic traffic, reducing cost during idle times and improving responsiveness during peak use.
- Carefully reviewed and applied **AWS security best practices**, including IAM roles and policies, to protect data and services from unauthorized access.

## üîë Most Valuable Skills Gained

Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with some of the most important aspects of ML engineering:

- **Cloud infrastructure management** for ML workflows, especially understanding how to pick and configure compute resources wisely.
- **Deploying scalable, real-time ML pipelines** using AWS Lambda, SageMaker endpoints, and API integration.
- **Cost optimization strategies** by selecting the right instance types and enabling auto-scaling.
- **Security configuration in AWS**, including IAM, networking boundaries, and access controls, which are critical in real-world deployments.
- The overall mindset of taking a project from ‚Äúresearch code‚Äù to a production-ready pipeline, which is a core responsibility of ML engineers in industry settings.

This project not only sharpened my technical skills with AWS but also deepened my understanding of how to **bridge the gap between data science and engineering**. I now feel much more confident deploying, securing, and optimizing ML models in real-world, scalable applications.
